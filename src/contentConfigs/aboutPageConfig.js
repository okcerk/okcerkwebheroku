        "When I was 13 I used Krecko as my Counter Strike nickname, one day I decided to flip it and that's how it became Okcerk. Argentine born, currently living in Seattle, WA, USA. I started drawing since I have memory, but my first flash animations happened back in 2003. In 2007 I released the first episode of Escuadron 37 and that kept somehow going until 2012. For a little bit over 5 years I did not do much, I was basically busy with university and later on work and more work. Of course I kept drawing on notebooks almost every single day of my life, but did not upload a thing. I even started drawing a few comics which I'll eventually upload. Anyhow, I hope you guys like what I upload here and if you see me around, say Hi and let's grab a beer. Andres Marc.",
