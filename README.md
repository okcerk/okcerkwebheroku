This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Configure heroku

1. Download Heroku cli from here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
2. Install, make sure path is set. If not go to system environment variables and modify Path both for current user and system
   and add path: C:/Program Files/heroku/bin
3. You may need to reboot VSCode to take the new env variables
4. From the root of this directory do:
   heroku login (this will open a browser where you'll have to login)
   heroku git:remote -a desolate-depths-91525 (where the last is the name of the app set in heroku, 
   in this case that's my app's name)

## Deploying

Once git+heroku are configured and all changes committed, make sure you do:
git push origin master
git push heroku master

So that both are kept in synch.
Ideally master should be updated first :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
